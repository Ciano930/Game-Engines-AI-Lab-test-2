# Game-Engines-AI-Lab-test-2


In this lab test a bee hive will be generated onto the field using user co'ords.
From this hive bees will generate for every 5 pollen the hive has.
Bees are generated at random sizes and with random points to follow.
Once a bee has found a flower that it can take pollen from it flies over and starts collecting.
After collecting all or as much pollen as the bee can carry it then flies back to the hive to deposit the pollen.
Bees have short life
